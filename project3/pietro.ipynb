    "## Introduction\n",
    "Since their introduction in 2014 by Goodfellow et al., Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have taken a predominant place in the deep learning landscape. GANs are deep neural networks composed of two parts: a generator and a discriminator. Those two parts are trained as opponents (hence \"adversarial\"): from the dataset, the generator tries to create new fake data that can fool the discriminator into thinking they are real, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between true and fake data. Often, the most interesting part of this model is the generator, therefore we often refer to GANs as generative models (even if they are also discriminative models). This generative property is used in a lot of applications: mainly for image processing task (style transfer, segmentation, face generation, image inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution,...), but also for natural language processing tasks (text summarization, text generation,...), for music generation or even for medical tasks (tumor detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another powerful architecture is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs naturally exploit invariances that are present in data (such that translation in images) in order, for example, to classify them. This is done by applying successive convolutions on data in order to extract the main features. Together with the backpropagation algorithm, the invention of CNN marked the revival of neural networks and deep learning in the 90's. Since then, they have found plenty of applications, mostly in image processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this homework in two parts is to implement your first GAN as well as your first CNN, to explore some properties and finally to combine them in order to generate what you desire."

    "\n",
    "Let's just recall what training a model means in machine learning. It is in fact quite simple: given a model architecture, use an optimization scheme to minimize a loss function (representing the gap between the data and the model predictions) in order to find the optimal values of the model parameters. In this Section, all of these elements are treated one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you receive reference Generator and Discriminator architectures. These neural network architectures should not be changed. Indeed, they are sufficient in order to get nice enough results while keeping the training time reasonable on a laptop CPU (normally less than 2 hours training).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you want to train additional Generator and/or Discriminator models that could be larger or smaller (for improved results or faster training for example), feel free to create them by yourself, explain them with comments and name them differently."
