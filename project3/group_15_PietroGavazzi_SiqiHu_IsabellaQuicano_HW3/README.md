## File Description

* `./Figures/`: the folder where to store the images;
* `.Latent_Vectors/`: the folder where to store the latent vectors;
* `./Models/`: the folder where to save the models;
* `create_cnn_model.py`: this file is used for doing the 3rd section;
* `create_gan_models.py`: this file is used for fining 3rd section;
* `README`: the file you are reading;
* `report.pdf`: the report for this homework;
* `section_1_2.ipynb`: the `Jupyter Notebook` for the 1st and the 2nd section of homework;
* `section_3.ipynb`: the `Jupyter Notebook` for the 3rd section;
* `section_4.ipynb`: the `Jupyter Notebook` for the 4th section;
* `tensor35.pt`: this file is used for section 3.

## How to run the code
For `section_4.ipynb` file, you can use the function already defined in the notebook, 
which is `shown_message()`. You may need to write a line of code in the last of the 
notebook as follows. And there will be a graph generated showing the 
message you just typed.

```python
# example 1
show_message(message="06041999", meaning="HER_BIRTHDAY")
```
